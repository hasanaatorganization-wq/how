                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: “The best of you are those who learn the Qur’an and teach it.” (Sahih al-Bukhari). Inspired by this noble teaching, Hasanaat Organization established the Qur’an Donation Project with the aim of ensuring that every Muslim, regardless of their background or circumstances, has access to the Holy Qur’an.</p>
                        For many mosques, Islamic schools, and underprivileged communities, obtaining copies of the Qur’an is a challenge due to financial constraints. Students may be forced to share a single copy among many, while new converts and families may struggle to own even one. This project addresses that gap by distributing Qur’ans to those in need, allowing them to learn, teach, and live by the divine guidance.</p>
                        Every copy donated is not merely a book—it is a source of light, guidance, and ongoing reward (sadaqah jariyah). Each time a verse is recited, memorized, or taught, the donor shares in the blessings. By contributing, you are investing in a continuous cycle of knowledge and faith that extends far beyond yourself.</p>
                        Through your generosity, we have already begun placing Qur’ans in mosques, madrassas, schools, and homes where they are most needed. With your continued support, we can expand this mission, ensuring that no believer is deprived of the chance to connect with the words of Allah.</p>
                        Join us in this blessed effort. A single Qur’an in the hands of a child, a student, or a new Muslim can transform lives, strengthen faith, and spread the mercy of Islam. Together, we can multiply the rewards and make the Qur’an accessible to every heart that seeks its guidance.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Knowledge is a cornerstone of Islam, and seeking it is a duty for every Muslim. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: “When a man dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.” (Sahih Muslim). Inspired by this teaching, Hasanaat Organization initiated the Islamic Books Donation Project to spread beneficial knowledge that enlightens minds and strengthens faith.</p>
                        This project focuses on distributing a wide range of Islamic books—covering Qur’an Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh, Seerah of the Prophet (ﷺ), Islamic morals, and other essential topics—to schools, madrassas, libraries, mosques, and individuals. Many communities lack access to reliable Islamic literature, leaving students and families without the resources to learn, understand, and live Islam fully. By making these books available, we bridge that gap and open doors to lifelong learning.</p>
                        Each book donated is more than just pages—it is a source of guidance, inspiration, and an enduring form of sadaqah jariyah. Every reader who benefits from it, every student who gains understanding, and every teacher who uses it to instruct others becomes a channel of reward for the donor.</p>
                        Through your generosity, we are equipping libraries, supporting Islamic schools, strengthening mosques, and placing authentic Islamic knowledge in the hands of learners and seekers worldwide. With your continued support, we can nurture communities that are spiritually stronger, morally upright, and firmly rooted in the teachings of Islam.</p>
                        Be part of this noble cause. By donating an Islamic book, you are not just gifting knowledge—you are shaping hearts, guiding generations, and earning endless reward in this life and the hereafter.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: “He is not a believer who eats his fill while his neighbor beside him is hungry.” (Hadith). Inspired by this powerful teaching, Hasanaat Organization established the Food Drive Program to fight hunger and restore dignity among the most vulnerable in our communities.</p>
                        Our food drives provide essential sustenance to struggling families, orphans, widows, and the elderly who often face the harsh reality of empty plates. Through the distribution of food packages, dry rations, and the organization of community kitchens, we ensure that no one under our care goes to bed hungry.</p>
                        Currently, Madrassatul Najah in Ongata Rongai is among the beneficiaries of this program. Here, children and learners not only receive spiritual nourishment through Islamic education, but also find relief in knowing that their basic nutritional needs are cared for. For many of these young learners, the meals provided are a lifeline that fuels both their bodies and their pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                        Every food package distributed is more than just a meal—it is a gift of hope, compassion, and relief. Your donations enable us to reach further, feed more, and extend mercy to those silently struggling with hunger. Each grain you contribute is an act of charity that carries immense reward, as the Prophet (ﷺ) reminded us that feeding the hungry is among the best deeds in Islam.</p>
                        By supporting the Hasanaat Food Drive, you are not just filling stomachs—you are uplifting lives, strengthening families, and building communities rooted in care and solidarity. Together, we can ensure that no neighbor, no child, and no elder is left to endure hunger alone.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Fulfilling the final rights of a Muslim is a communal obligation (Fard Kifayah). Among these rights is the proper and dignified ritual washing (ghusl) of the deceased before burial. Recognizing the importance of this sacred duty, Hasanaat Organization, in partnership with the local community, has initiated the Ghusl Room Building Project to ensure that our brothers and sisters are given an Islamically-compliant and honorable final farewell.</p>
                        Alhamdulillah, the ghusl facility is now complete at Masjid Yusuf – Prison Masjid, Machakos County. The building has been constructed and body trays have already been purchased, providing a clean, secure, and respectful environment for preparing the deceased. This facility will serve the surrounding Muslim community, easing the burden on families during their most difficult moments and upholding the dignity of those who return to Allah ﷻ.</p>
                        As the project advances, there remains an urgent need to purchase a washing bed, which is essential for completing the setup of the ghusl room. We therefore humbly urge members of the community and well-wishers to contribute towards this final requirement.</p>
                        Supporting this initiative is a sadaqah jariyah—a continuous charity—where every act of washing and every funeral prayer carried out in this facility becomes a source of ongoing reward for those who contributed. By donating, you are not only assisting in fulfilling the rights of fellow Muslims but also ensuring your share in the blessings of every service rendered here for years to come.</p>
                        Join us in completing this noble project. Together, let us uphold the dignity of our deceased and fulfill one of the most important communal responsibilities in Islam.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Islam teaches us compassion, mercy and the possibility of redemption. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) reminded us that the best among us are those who bring benefit to others and this includes extending kindness and guidance to those behind prison walls. Guided by this principle, Hasanaat Organization established the Prison Visit Program to serve inmates with spiritual, emotional, and moral support.</p>
                        Through this program, our dedicated team visits prisons to provide spiritual counseling, Islamic education and moral upliftment. We strive to remind inmates of Allah’s mercy, encourage sincere repentance and guide them towards positive change. By fostering rehabilitation through faith, we help prepare individuals for reintegration into society as responsible, spiritually grounded members.</p>
                        In addition to counseling, Hasanaat Organization also provides Islamic materials to inmates—including Qur’ans, Islamic books, and other educational resources. These serve as companions for reflection and learning, offering light and hope in what is often a very dark environment. For many inmates, these materials are their first real connection to structured Islamic knowledge, helping them rediscover their faith and purpose.</p>
                        The Prison Visit Program is not just about supporting it is about transformation. Every inmate who reconnects with the Qur’an, embraces repentance, or gains moral strength becomes a testimony to the power of compassion and guidance.</p>
                        Your support enables us to continue reaching prisons, providing essential Islamic resources, and nurturing hope where it is most needed. By contributing, you are planting seeds of faith and change that may impact generations to come.
